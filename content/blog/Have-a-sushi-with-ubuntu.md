If you love quick preview feature in MacOS and you are missing that in your ubuntu, have a sushi and you will be satisfied. Even if you are not a MacOS user, you will get so used to with sushi that you will never get satisfied. You might be thinking what I am babbling about. I am talking about a quick preview of most of the popular file in ubuntu that is provided by gnome-sushi. I have tested with some script files such as `py`, `*r`, `*md`, `json`. You can also play `mp3` and other audio, preview images and pdf with just a spacebar. To install sushi, open up your terminal and run,

```sh
apt install gnome-sushi
```

Most probably, you might need to use `sudo` as well.
